Using exclusive option in MPI jobs

If your jobs require dedicated nodes (example: MPI jobs), you will have to use

#SBATCH —exclusive

option in your submission script.

When you use —exclusive option, the job allocation cannot share nodes with other running jobs, which is important to avoid other jobs potentially interfering with your MPI 
job.

On MERCED cluster, the default partition configuration is shared and oversubscribed.
