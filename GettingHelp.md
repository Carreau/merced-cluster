The MERCED Cluster is a resource available to students and faculty who have a
need for a parallel computing environment. Other systems are specific to their
faculty-owners, but are  managed by Research Computing. Account requests and
approvals are required to access these systems.

# Research IT consultation 

https://it.ucmerced.edu/content/research-it-consultation

OIT provides Research IT assessments for individuals and research groups who
wish to deploy research computing and advanced cyberinfrastructure techniques
(e.g. high-performance computing, visualization, advanced networking and data
collaboration, and advanced technology-enhaned workflow development).


# Research Software installation on clusters

https://it.ucmerced.edu/content/research-software-installation-server-and-cluster

You may request help in installing academic or commercial software that is
properly licensed on Research Computing-managed servers or clusters. For
installations on the MERCED Cluster, users may install software in their home
directories without prior permission. For global installation on the MERCED
Cluster (e.g. access to the software for multiple users), installation on other
servers or clusters, or for help in installing software on Research
Computing-managed systems, users may request this service via this form.

# Other

Any other Research Computing requests that do not fall under these categories
can be placed by clicking on "Submit a General IT request" in IT website
(it.ucmerced.edu). General information regarding MERCED cluster can be found
in HPC Wiki Knowledgebase articles (hpcwiki.ucmerced.edu) .
